# Kernel-Web-NewLook
A New UI/UX Design for "Linux Kernel Archive" Website!

"The Linux Kernel Archive is having a 1980's look design on their website. So i thought why not give them a new refreshed Modern Look because it's 2024 and i hope that they might gonna like it and maybe they will be interested to use this
Front-end design in 2025 or later. And i didn't and any server-side language is because most gnu/linux communities love PHP programming language over JavaScript programming language. So i thought if they do the server-side coding with their 
favorite programming language that will be good!" :-)
